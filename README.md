The Data + Analytics team in DJPR Strategy + Priority Projects will make
many Shiny apps. The `djprshiny` package is a place to house code to be
re-used across multiple apps. This includes custom CSS and visual
components, as well as commonly-used modules.

## Installation

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djpr-data/djprshiny")
